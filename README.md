There are to be several bin crates to work with zip (?) files. 
It is to be a file processing pipeline. At the later stages the shift is to be from processing a file to processing a data in a file. 
The final structure on the pipelines is still not clear, has to be aised within the project development. 

Now we have: 

main.rs -> get the zip file from web
read.rs unzip and read the zipped files
